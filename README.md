# last-fm-now-playing-php
Displays an image generated with PHP/GD2 of my last fm current song.


# Things you need to know:

* I cannot distribute arial.ttf. You probably have it on your computer. C:\Windows\Fonts\ is the most likely place.
* You can generate a Last.FM api key here for plugging into the script:
* Edit the lines for the api key, user name, and social media string at the top and find yourself some php webhosting and this should work perfectly fine.
